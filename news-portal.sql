And the Delhi Capitals captain is trying to make his way back into the Indian side through IPL.\r\nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Jay Shah is hopeful of Rishabh Pant getting back into competitive cricket soon and informed that the BCCI is monitoring his progress on a daily basis.\r\n\r\nPant is currently recovering from injuries he sustained during a car accident 15 months ago, and has resumed his batting and wicket-keeping post the mishap in December 2022.\r\n\r\nâ€œPant is doing well and he is batting and is also keeping. In the near future, we (BCCI) will declare him fit. If he can play the T20 World Cup for India, that will be a big thing for us. He is a big asset for us,â€ Shah said during an interaction on the sidelines of the fifth Test match between India-England in Dharmsala.\r\n\r\nA fit Pant, now 26, would be a vital player going ahead for the Indian team during ICC T20 World Cup to be held in West Indies and USA later this year in June. Shah has made it clear that Pantâ€™s return will be decided by the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore where VVS Laxman, head of NCA and Nitin Patel, NCA, head sports and science, are monitoring his fitness report.\r\n\r\nShah added, â€œThe door is open for him.

And the Delhi Capitals captain is trying to make his way back into the Indian side through IPL. Speaking to The ICC Review, Delhi Capitals coach Ricky Ponting stated he is expecting Pant to captain from the start of the forthcoming IPL season, should his fitness allow.\r\n\r\nâ€œItâ€™s a big decision weâ€™ll have to make because if he is fit, youâ€™d think heâ€™d step straight back into that captaincy role. If heâ€™s not entirely fit and we have to use him in a slightly different role, then weâ€™ve got some decisions to make there,â€ Ponting said.\r\n\r\nPant played some practice games and Ponting is hopeful that he will be available for DCâ€™s opening match against Punjab Kings at Mohali which is scheduled for March 23.\r\n\r\nâ€œHeâ€™s actually played some practice matches over the last couple of weeks, which has been really encouraging for us. I know heâ€™s worked incredibly hard on his body and his fitness to get back to the level that heâ€™s at now. Heâ€™s kept in one of those games, heâ€™s fielded in these games and the batting hasnâ€™t seemingly been an issue for him so far,â€ he explained. Further adding, â€œWeâ€™ve obviously had worries and concerns that he might not have made it in time to be ready for the IPL this year.

After he made the move on Sunday, Sena (UBT) MP Sanjay Raut alleged that the three-time MLA was under pressure from investigating agencies.\r\n\r\nMumbai: Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde welcomes Shiv Sena (UBT) MLA Ravindra Waikar as he joins Shiv Sene (Shinde) faction, in Mumbai, Sunday, March 10, 2024. (PTI Photo)\r\nShiv Sena (UBT) MLA Ravindra Waikar who joined the Shiv Sena led by Maharashtra Chief Minister Eknath Shinde on Sunday night was a close associate of party chief Uddhav Thackeray. He has been under the lens of the Mumbai Policeâ€™s Economic Offences Wing (EOW) and the Enforcement Directorate (ED) in connection with the construction of a luxury hotel in the city, allegedly in violation of an agreement with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).\r\n\r\nThere has been speculation for months that Waikar might switch to the ruling alliance. After he changed camps, Sena (UBT) MP and spokesperson Sanjay Raut alleged that the MLA was facing pressure from investigating agencies and was being threatened to either defect or face jail. The EOW had booked Waikar and five others on a complaint by BJP leader Kirit Somaiya who alleged that the Sena politician was involved in a Rs 500 crore scam. Somaiya alleged that Waikar fraudulently obtained approval for the construction of a five-star hotel on a plot reserved for a garden by using his political clout, causing a huge loss to the BMC.\r\n\r\nBased on the Mumbai Policeâ€™s FIR, the ED registered a case of money laundering against Waikar last November. The central agency also raided seven premises linked to Waikar and questioned him a few times.\r\n\r\nA three-time MLA, the 65-year-old Waikar started his political career as a grassroots-level Shiv Sainik in the 1980s and became a BMC corporator from Mumbaiâ€™s Jogeshwari area. He was elected corporator for four consecutive terms and served as the chairperson of the BMC standing committee from 2006 to 2009. He was thrice elected MLA from Jogeshwari East thrice â€“ in 2009, 2014, and 2019.\r\n\r\nWaikar also held the portfolio of Minister of State for Housing and Higher and Technical Education from 2015 to 2019 in the BJP-Shiv Sena state government led by Devendra Fadnavus. Later, in the Uddhav-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government that was in power from November 2019 to June 2022, he was the guardian minister of his home district Ratnagiri.\r\n\r\nKnown as a staunch Shiv Sainik and trusted colleague of Uddhav, Waikar played a major role in building the organisational structure of the Shiv Sena after Uddhav took over the partyâ€™s reins in 2003. He played a major role in election campaigning, especially after the death of Sena founder Bal Thackeray in 2012. He was also instrumental in the construction of the Shiv Sena Bhavan, the partyâ€™s headquarters in Dadar, and the partyâ€™s legislative office Shivalaya in Mumbai, and was considered the go-to person for Uddhav before he took any major decisions.\r\n\r\nSince 2014, Waikar, who has family relations with the Thackerays, has faced a string of allegations from Congress and BJP leaders. The accusations were, however, always considered to be an attack on the Thackerays as their proximity was well-known.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2016, Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam accused the MLA of usurping a public plot at Aarey Milk Colony and carrying out illegal construction at a gymnasium built there using his legislator funds. At the time, Nirupam met then CM Fadnavis and sought to sack the Sena leader from the Cabinet. Nirupam also alleged that Waikar misused his ministerial position to benefit companies linked to him by furthering six slum redevelopment projects in Andheri and Jogeshwari.\r\n\r\nIn 2020, Somaiya raised allegations of financial deals between the Thackerays and the family of interior designer Anvay Naik who had died by suicide along with his mother two years earlier. After Waikarâ€™s wife Manisha moved a defamation suit against Somaiya, the Bombay High Court restrained the BJP leader from levelling further allegations in public.', '2024-03-12', 1, 1),

(42, 2, 5, 'What is CNAP, TRAIâ€™s proposed Caller ID service to reduce spam calls', 'article-2-1710228540.avif', 'The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, commonly referred to as TRAI, recently recommended the introduction of Calling Name Presentation (CNAP) by telecom operators. The feature will allow users to see the callerâ€™s name and might help combat spam calls. While there are already several third-party services like Truecaller that show the name of the caller, the information is mostly crowd-sourced and therefore may not be accurate.\r\n\r\nWhat is CNAP?\r\nCaller Name Presentation, abbreviated as CNAP, is a service similar to Truecaller that will show the callerâ€™s name. In 2022, TRAI floated a consultation paper that proposed some methods through which the feature could be implemented. After talking with telecom networks for over a year, based on the comments and inputs received from stakeholders and its analysis, the regulatory body has finalized recommendations for network providers like Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone-Idea.\r\n\r\nAccording to TRAI, network providers should use the name identity provided by telephone subscribers in their Customer Application Form (CAF) for CNAP, and all service providers should provide the facility to their subscribers upon request. This means the name you use when purchasing a SIM card will be the one visible to the person you are calling.\r\n\r\nAs for businesses that buy bulk connections, they will be given the option to show a â€˜preferred nameâ€™ instead of the name appearing on the customer application form. This can either be the trademark name registered with the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, GST Council, or other unique names registered with the government.\r\n\r\nAfter these recommendations are accepted, TRAI says the Government of India will issue instructions for network operators to make CNAP available on all devices sold in the country after a certain cut-off date, which has not yet been finalized.\r\n\r\nHow does CNAP work?\r\nAccording to recommendations shared by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, Airtel, Reliance Jio, and Vodafone Idea are to create and maintain a database that contains customer names along with their phone number.\r\n\r\nWhen a user gets a call, the network provider will refer and use the databases maintained by network providers to get the name of the caller and show it to the other person. However, before CNAP is rolled out country-wide, TRAI recommends that the feature be tested on a trial basis.\r\n\r\nWhen TRAI proposed the introduction of CNAP in early 2023, the Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), which represents Airtel, Jio, and Vodafone Idea, raised privacy concerns stating that the feature â€œcould result in the breach of subscriber data privacy as the manufacturers of mobile devices and OS providers would amass subscriber data for the entire country.â€ The association added that the introduction of CNAP would be similar to â€œbuilding up the name and mobile number database as is in the Aadhaar database, with 3rd parties.â€\r\n\r\nReliance Jio also said that displaying the name of the caller at the time of calling might â€œlead to various social and criminal issuesâ€ and that the customer should be asked if they want to opt-in to CNAP before activating the service on their device. Bharti Airtel also echoed similar sentiments, saying that user privacy would have to be factored in when rolling out CNAP and that the system should initially be limited to telemarketers and commercial users. Vodafone Idea said CNAP will be a step forward in combating the ever-increasing spam calls, but the feature might â€œconflict with the privacy concern of the calling party who may not want to flash his/her name onto the screen of the called party.â€\r\n\r\nIf you do not want others to see your name when they get a call, TRAI notes subscribers can avail the Calling Line Identification Restriction (CLIR) facility that was introduced in 2015.\r\n\r\nHow is it different from services like Truecaller?\r\nCaller identification services like Truecaller are based on crowd-sourced information, which may not always be accurate. On the other hand, the CNAP database will be based on information obtained from the Customer Application Form (CAF), which is verified using Government-recognized identity proofs. While the KYC process is not watertight, the information obtained from the CNAP database might be considerably more accurate compared to crowd-sourced services.\r\n\r\n', '2024-03-12', 1, 1),

Delhiâ€™s Indraprastha Apollo Hospital has installed South Asiaâ€™s first ZAP-X machine that can precisely deliver radiation to kill brain tumours. It is non-invasive, pain-free and does not require a hospital admission unlike a traditional surgery. Costing the same as surgery, a single session will be enough in most cases.\r\n\r\nHow does it work?\r\n\r\nThe machine delivers high-intensity, focussed radiation to just the brain tumour with less than a millimetre precision, leaving the surrounding tissue undamaged. This kills the tumour, which later dissolves naturally.\r\n\r\nDr John Adler, creator of the machine and CEO of Zap Surgical, said, â€œRadiosurgery is the most common procedure that neurosurgeons do in the US but globally less than one in 10 patients gets access. There is a huge gap. This machine was designed keeping in mind the rest of the world. Nearly a million people can benefit from this therapy in India.â€\r\n\r\nWhat are the machineâ€™s benefits over traditional surgery?\r\n\r\nNot only does it remove the need to get admitted to a hospital or go under anaesthesia, it improves patient outcomes because no post-surgery recovery is needed. The out-patient treatment is just done in a single session of 30 minutes to a maximum of one hour 30 minutes. According to doctors, multiple sessions are planned only when the tumour is too big or close to important structures in the brain.\r\n\r\nThe precise, non-invasive nature of the technique means that the therapy can preserve all critical structures in the brain, including the brain stem, eyes, optic nerves and parts that control bodily functions.\r\n\r\nThe treatment is not meant for every kind of tumour â€” huge tumours or those that have metastasised are unlikely to be operated with the new machine. The treatment is meant for those with a well-defined tumour of less than 3X3X3 cm â€” the therapy for bigger tumours is only restricted by the radiation doses that can be offered without poisoning.\r\n\r\nIt will be better than a surgery for patients who have been diagnosed with a tumour deep in the brain, close to important structures, or incidentally (small tumours detected during scans for other issues).\r\n\r\nAlso Read | Brain Tumour: Know the causes, symptoms and treatment\r\nNot only does the machine treat tumours, it can also treat deep lesions in the brain or arteriovenous malformation (abnormal connections between oxygenated blood carrying arteries and deoxygenated blood carrying veins in the brain or the spine).\r\n\r\nHow much will it cost?\r\n\r\nDoctors from the hospital said that the cost for treatment on Zap-X will be equivalent to traditional surgery, with the added benefit of no post-operative costs. Outside India, the cost is about $4000.\r\n\r\nHow does it differ from radiotherapy used in cancers or other radiosurgery techniques?\r\n\r\nRadiotherapy harnesses the power of radiation to treat cancers but it is more diffused and is helpful in scenarios where a tumour has metastasised. As Dr Adler said, â€œRadiotherapy is like the sunlight, the impact is low and the exposure time is high. Radiosurgery â€” and technologies like Zap-X â€” are akin to using a magnifying glass to concentrate the radiation to a particular point. The intensity is very different,â€ he said.\r\n\r\nOther radiotherapy techniques such as cyberknife and gammaknife also use the same principle, he explained, but they are not primed for the treatment of the brain alone.\r\n\r\nThe other benefit of the therapy is that it does not require a radioactive source to be housed in a separate concrete building to contain the radiation. In fact, one person can be with the patient at the time of the treatment on Zap-X.', '2024-03-12', 1, 1),

It has helped them become the most consistent franchise with five titles -- level with Mumbai Indians -- and reaching the knockouts in 12 of their 14 seasons.\r\n\r\nWith a good spin attack to exploit the playing surface and packing the side with good hitters against spin, they turn their home turf, MA Chidambaram Stadium, into a fortress. Last year, out of the eight games in Chennai, CSK won five, including the Qualifier. In 2024, one can expect similar domination at home. The pitches are expected to grip and turn, and CSK have the batters to do well.\r\n\r\nHindustan Times - your fastest source for breaking news! Read now.\r\nTo add to their already balanced side, they have again done some smart picks at the auction, getting New Zealand\'s Rachin Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell, who should both fit well into their spin plans. Most of their batters are touch players. Ruturaj Gaikwad, Ravindra and Ajinkya Rahane all thrive on timing shots than power-hitting.\r\n\r\n\r\nShivam Dube is their designated spin-hitter. Mitchell was brilliant against spin in the ICC World Cup with a hundred against India in the semi-final. CSK\'s big auction pick among domestic players, Uttar Pradesh middle-order batter Sameer Rizvi, also has a strong game against spin.\r\n\r\nFrom last season\'s winning side, they will miss injured opener Devon Conway while Ambati Rayudu has retired. In place of Conway, Ravindra is a ready-made option to open with Ruturaj. At No.3, they have Rahane or Moeen Ali. Mitchell, Dube, Ravindra Jadeja and Rizvi are strong middle-order options.\r\n\r\nIn the lower order, the focus will be on Dhoni. Though CSK now mainly look at him to keep wicket and lead, Dhoni is still quite effective in the slog overs. Coming in at No.8-9, he played typically small, impact innings last year. In fewer than 60 balls, he got only 104 runs but at a strike rate of 182.46. Even if he is not batting well, CSK can always call upon an Impact Player.\r\n\r\n\r\nDhoni\'s captaincy gives CSK the edge because he understands the grounds all over the country. He knows the angles to post the fielders, which can especially be challenging at Chepauk because of its bigger boundaries. Also, he uses the spinners very well to control the middle overs. He knows whom to use when. For example, Jadeja bowls only after the powerplay. Dhoni should be happy with his spin options. Besides Jadeja, there\'s Moeen Ali, Maheesh Theekshana, Mitchell Santner and Ravindra.\r\n\r\nCSK have a predictable formula, but it works. They don\'t even change the batting order a lot. But this time, how Dhoni uses Mitchell remains to be seen. With the four-foreign player rule in place, it is likely to be a toss up between Mustafizur Rahman and Mitchell.\r\n\r\n\r\nPACE ATTACK\r\nCSK did some great things with a very young pace attack last season, where Tushar Deshpande (CSK\'s leading bowler with 21 scalps) and Matheesha Pathirana (19 wickets) had a good season. Jadeja took 20 wickets.\r\n\r\nThis year, CSK have got back all-rounder Shardul Thakur. Deepak Chahar and Mustafizur are also experienced campaigners. Pathirana is sidelined with a hamstring injury but left-arm pacer Mukesh Choudhary is back after missing last season due to injury.\r\n\r\nThakur and Chahar are both effective batters while Deshpande is also a handy player down the order as his hundred for Mumbai in the Ranji Trophy semi-final showed.\r\n\r\nCSKâ€™s strategy is simple: target to win at least five out of seven home games and look to get three wins in the seven away games. Once they qualify for the play-offs, they know how to handle the pressure of big games.', '2024-03-23', 0, 1),

These were the first exports after the ban kicked in.\r\n\r\nâ€œWhile all the supplies have not yet reached Bangladesh through the National Cooperative Exports Ltd, the Indian governmentâ€™s decision had the effect of immediately cooling prices in Bangladeshi markets, which had increased sharply since last year,â€ one of the people cited above said.\r\n\r\nâ€œThe move to have fixed quotas for these five commodities is aimed at having some protection from export bans and ensuring uninterrupted and assured supplies every year,â€ the person added.\r\n\r\nThere was no official word from the Indian side on the request from Bangladesh, which figured in visiting Bangladesh foreign minister Hasan Mahmudâ€™s meeting with commerce minister Piyush Goyal in New Delhi in January. Mahmud told reporters at the time he had sought additional supplies of sugar and onions in line with the Sheikh Hasina governmentâ€™s focus on reducing the prices of essential commodities.\r\n\r\n\r\nBangladeshâ€™s imports of rice from India increased from $9.7 billion in 2021-22 to $11.1 billion in 2022-23, while wheat imports were worth $2.1 billion in 2021-22 and $1.5 billion in 2022-23, according to official figures from the Indian side.\r\n\r\nImports of onions from India increased from $460.5 million in 2021-22 to $561.8 million in 2022-23, while imports of ginger fell from $93 million in 2021-22 to $35.9 million in 2022-23. Imports of garlic rose sharply from $2.9 million in 2021-22 to $11.3 million in 2022-23.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, Indiaâ€™s ban on onion exports due to soaring domestic prices had a major impact on Bangladesh. During a visit to India at the time, Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina jokingly told a business forum in New Delhi in the presence of Goyal that she had asked her cook to stop using onions. She also said India should alert Bangladesh in advance about such bans.', '2024-03-28', 0, 1),

What goes on your skin also gets absorbed into your skin and body hence, it is important to choose the right ingredients that help your skin flourish naturally with age.\r\n\r\nIn an interview with HT Lifestyle, Yukta Raghu, CEO and Co-Founder of AFFOREST Green Beauty, shared, â€œOne such brewing goodness are teas, which are popularly being used in skincare, if not as an entire product but blended as extracts to help the skin with their extensive benefits. They have natural antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Teas like chamomile and purple provide essential vitamins and minerals that promote a healthy complexion and are extremely antioxidant-rich, which help protect skin from environmental stressors. Blue elixir teas are becoming popular in organic skincare because of their astringent properties, which help to tighten, tone and reduce the appearance of pores.â€\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Infusions: Steeping the teas in hot water to create a concentrated infusion, which can then be added to skincare formulations such as toners, serums or creams.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Extracts: Creating extracts by concentrating the active compounds of the teas through methods like maceration or solvent extraction. These extracts can then be incorporated into skincare products for targeted benefits.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Facial Steams (Homemade Remedy): Using the teas in facial steams can help open pores, allowing the skin to better absorb nutrients and antioxidants from the teas.\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Masks (homemade remedy): mixing the teas with other natural ingredients like honey, yoghurt or clays to create nourishing and purifying face masks.\r\n\r\nSuggesting to use tea extracts to blend with other botanical extracts to make them highly effective, Yukta Raghu encouraged using the tea extracts as they offer a multitude of benefits due to their rich concentration of bioactive compounds and antioxidants. She said, â€œIn a nutshell, teas in skincare can offer as many benefits as they do when consumed. Topical application of teas blended with the right formula can do wonders for your skin due to their natural compounds, antioxidants and other bio active components.â€ If we break it up, we get benefits like:\r\n\r\n\r\nSkincare: antioxidant protection, anti-inflammatory properties, hydration, and nourishment can target skin conditions like eczema, psoriasis, or acne due to their antimicrobial properties.\r\nWellness: stress relief, digestive aid and immune support\r\nGut Health: Prebiotic Properties, Anti-inflammatory Effects and Hydration.\r\nFor the uninitiated, Hibiscus and Butterfly Pea Flower lend their enchanting colours to these teas, creating a rainbow of antioxidants that can work wonders for your well-being. Butterfly Pea Flower is infused with rich anthocyanins and flavonoids and potent antioxidants known for their immune-boosting properties where these compounds help combat oxidative stress, supporting your body\'s natural defenses whereas Hibiscus, a key ingredient in purple tea, brings not only its deep red hue but also a powerhouse of vitamin C and antioxidants and studies suggest that regular consumption of hibiscus tea may contribute to lower blood pressure and improved heart health, further enhancing the overall well-being of individuals.', '2024-03-28', 0, 1),

It was an exhibition in power-hitting, leaving bowlers from both teams bewildered by the relentless onslaught.\r\n\r\n\r\nSRH\'s opening batter, Travis Head, kickstarted the onslaught with a blistering 62 runs off just 24 deliveries, setting the tone for their innings. His explosive innings was complemented by a sensational display from number three batter Abhishek Sharma, who smashed 63 runs off a mere 23 balls, swiftly overtaking Head to claim the franchise record for the fastest fifty.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fireworks didn\'t end there, as Heinrich Klaasen delivered a scintillating performance, remaining unbeaten with 80 runs off 34 balls. His late onslaught not only propelled SRH to a monumental total but also shattered an 11-year-old IPL record previously held by Royal Challengers Bangalore, who had scored 263/5 in 2013.\r\n\r\nDespite Mumbai Indians being left shell-shocked by SRH\'s relentless six-hitting spree, their batters showcased bravery in the mammoth chase. What initially seemed like a one-sided affair at the innings break gradually transformed into a competitive showdown; Ishan Kishan (34 off 13 balls), Rohit Sharma (26 off 12 balls), Naman Dhir (30 off 14 balls) were all impressive in their fiery starts, while Tilak Varma also produced a brilliant performance with a 34-ball 64.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe momentum, however, shifted in SRH\'s favour following the dismissal of Tilak; captain Hardik Pandya (24 off 20 balls) was put in a spot by brilliant spells from Jaydev Unadkat, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, and Pat Cummins, and despite Tim David\'s unbeaten 42 (off 22 deliveries), MI fell short by 31 runs.\r\n\r\nThe match did see multiple records being shattered by the end of it all, etching its name in IPL history.\r\n\r\nHighest team totals in the IPL:\r\nFirst and foremost, SRH broke the record for the most runs in a single innings by a team in the Indian Premier League.
